# Probability Distributions and Stock Prediction Analysis

This project involves analyzing five datasets: SAT scores, lunch wait times, student ages, stock prices, and stock prediction data. The analysis includes both probability distribution analysis and basic stock price prediction.

## Datasets

The following CSV files are used for analysis:

- **SAT.csv**: Contains a list of SAT scores.
- **Lunch_wait_time.csv**: Contains the waiting time (in minutes) for lunch.
- **Student_age.csv**: Contains the ages of students.
- **Stock_price.csv**: Contains historical stock price data.
- **Stock_prediction_data.csv**: Contains data used for making stock price predictions.

## Visualizations

- Histograms: Generated for SAT scores, lunch wait times, and student ages.
- Stock Price Plot: Displays historical stock prices over time.
